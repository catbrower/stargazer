These values work in the same way as longitude and latitude except that they measure positions in the sky insead of on earth. When this is combined with Hipparcos' accurate distance information, the x, y, z positions of stars can be calculated."

Our ultimate goal is to replace out Hipparcos data with that of Gaia, allowing us to create an even larger model of our galaxy."
